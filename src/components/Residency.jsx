                  The scope of feverdream includes any young, local, emerging
                  artists with high potential that showcase excellence in the
                  mediums of painting and drawing. Local is defined as
                  Ohio-based within a 2 hour radius. Artist collectives will not
                  be eligible. feverdream is an open call for artists to apply
                  where they will be adjudicated on the quality and promise of
                  their proposal.

                  There is roughly 1 month between when you are notified as
                  being the final selected resident and when your residency
                  starts. But because of our dynamic Phase One calendar there
                  may be more time. You will be notified when your session will
                  start if you are the selected resident.

                  We are not able to provide specific individual feedback to
                  applicants. To reiterate what was previously mentioned, make
                  sure your application is complete , your proposal is clear,
                  and the submitted work is strong and documented in a
                  professional manner.
