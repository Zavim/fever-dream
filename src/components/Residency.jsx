                  The scope of feverdream includes any young, local, emerging
                  artists with high potential that showcase excellence in the
                  mediums of painting and drawing. Local is defined as
                  Ohio-based within a 2 hour radius. Artist collectives will not
                  be eligible. feverdream is an open call for artists to apply
                  where they will be adjudicated on the quality and promise of
                  their proposal.
